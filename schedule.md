## III. Putting it Together

**YOU** will be in the driver’s seat for Weeks 10 and 11.
1. The class will vote on a topic(s) that you would like to learn more about. This can consist of revisiting a topic (ex. “we want to know more about spatial history”) or exploring a brand-new topic (ex. “we want to learn about machine learning”). I will then select readings for these two weeks and we will discuss them during the first hour of class.
2. Each student will choose **one method or skill** that you want to learn in more depth. I will be working with each of you to find tutorials, hands-on practicums, or other strategies that you will work on during the second half of these classes.

### Week 10, 11/6: Practicum
