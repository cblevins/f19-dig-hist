### Introduction

Based on the interests and votes you expressed in Week 9, I've come up with several different hands-on "paths" you can take for the hands-on portion of class. I've divided these into different clusters.


### Mapping and QGIS

This is for people who are interested in more robust spatial analysis: making and working with spatial data and digitized historical maps, overlaying different kinds of geographical information, looking for spatial patterns, etc. QGIS is an open-source version of the widely used ArcGIS platform from ESRI software. Here are a series of three tutorials from historian Fred Gibbs geared specifically for history students:

1. ["Making a Map with QGIS"](http://fredgibbs.net/tutorials/qgis/making-a-map-with-qgis.html)
2. ["Linking and Styling Data with QGIS"](http://fredgibbs.net/tutorials/qgis/linking-and-styling-data-with-qgis.html)
3. ["Using Historic Maps with QGIS"](http://fredgibbs.net/tutorials/qgis/overlaying-historic-maps-with-qgis.html)


### Time- and Map-based Narratives

1. Hands-on tutorial on ArcGIS Story Maps with BahareÂ Sanaie-Movahed (in class on 11/6)
2. [Tutorial on making a timeline with Timeline.js](({{site.baseurl}}/week-10/week-10-timeline))
3. JMU Digital Communication Consulting, ["Introduction to StoryMap"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_hKGk6sn5E)
4. J. Kirby, [Neatline 101](https://publish.illinois.edu/commonsknowledge/2017/07/05/neatline-101-getting-started/) (Neatline is a plugin for Omeka that allows you to create map- and timeline-based narratives using an Omeka collection)

### Tableau

1. [Series of training videos on Tableau](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/tableau-essential-training-2/) - especially no. 2, 3, 4, 9, and 12.

### Python

I've located several exercises and tutorials for Python that will help you with common tasks and skills:

1. Ethan Reed and Brandon Walsh, [Working with CSV files](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/humanitiesprogramming/humanitiesprogramming.github.io/blob/master/python/notebooks/working-with-csv.ipynb), *Introduction to Programming for Humanists*
2. William J. Turkel and Adam Crymble, [Downloading Webpages with Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-web-pages), *Programming Historian*
2. [Python and Library of Congress's *Chronicling America* database](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration/blob/master/ChronAm%20API%20Samples.ipynb)
3. [Data Exploration: Accessing Images from the Library of Congress](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration/blob/master/Accessing%20images%20for%20analysis.ipynb)
