title: Week 4 Homework
---

You're going to submit your first homework of the semester using a Jupyter Notebook. First create a new directory within your class folder called `week-04` and then save a new Jupyter Notebook in that directory with the filename: `yourlastname-week-04-homework.ipynb`. Please use this naming convention for all of your homework submissions, as this will let me keep track of them. 

You are going to write some Python code to generate information about the historical figure Lucy Parsons. In Step 1 you are going to manually enter information about Parsons as variables. In the rest of the steps you are going to *calculate* an answer using those same variables and some operations. Refer back to the [in-class portion of Week 3]({{site.baseurl}}/week-03/week-03-getting-started-with-python.ipynb) to help you.

To replicate best coding practices, you're going to use alternating Markdown and Code cells. The Markdown cell should document what you're doing in the following Code cell in your own words (it doesn't have to be super detailed), while the code cell should contain the Python code.

1. Use Lucy Parsons's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Parsons) to assign variables about some of her biographical information:
  * `first_name`
  * `last_name`
  * `birth_year` - the year she was born
  * `birth_state` - the state she was born in
2. Make a new variable `full_name` and assign it a string value using the variables `first_name` and `last_name`. Print the value of `full_name`.
3. How many letters ("characters") are in the name of the state in which Parsons was born (`birth_state`)? Print the result.
4. Calculate Lucy Parsons's age during the Haymarket affair, which happened in 1886 and assign it to a new variable `haymarket_age`, then print the value of that variable.

**Remember** to name your Jupyter Notebook with the convention described above and then upload it to: <https://www.dropbox.com/request/6DlmzXwe51JsbvFrlQ4c>.
