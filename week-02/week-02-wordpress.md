## Warm-Up

Each of you are going to look at a professional website from an academic (I've mixed together Northeastern people and others):

1. http://jguiliano.com/
2. https://mollynebiolo.com/
3. http://6floors.org/
4. https://ryancordell.org/
5. http://erinbush.org/
6. https://www.moyabailey.com/
7. http://roopikarisam.com/
8. http://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/ 
9. https://zoeleblanc.com/
10. http://www.lauraknelson.com/

Go through the website and think about what kind of information it includes, how it is organized, what message it is sending about the person.

With the person next to you, compare notes:

- What are the similarities and differences in terms of content?
- What are similarities and differences in terms of design and layout?
- What one is more appealing or informative to you as a viewer - let’s say you’re thinking about taking a class with one of them or want to do some kind of project with them - what is helpful and what isn’t? It’s okay to be honest. :)


## Install a Wordpress Site

Today we are going to install a Wordpress site that will be hosted with your account at Reclaim hosting. Rather than create your own professional website, to begin we're going to create a site within a sub-directory of your main site. This is going to function as a "sandbox" to play around in during the course of the semester.  

Follow these instructions to install a Wordpress site under Reclaim Hosting: <https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/installing-wordpress/265>

**Important Notes!!!**

- Be sure to include the following under Directory(Optional): ```f19-dig-hist-sandbox```
- Choose a username and password that you can remember and copy/paste it somewhere for your reference. This is what you're going to use to log in to this Wordpress site moving forward.

Now you should have a website installed under ```http://yourdomainname/f19-dig-hist-sandbox```. To access the Control Panel for this site, go to ```http://yourdomainname/f19-dig-hist-sandbox/wp-admin``` and log in using the username and password you specified earlier.

## Play Around

Try to figure out how to do the following:

- Make a new page titled Week 2 and write a few sentences about yourself.
- Copy and paste the content from your Week 2 page into a new Blog Post with an identical title.
- Choose a different Wordpress theme than the default one

## Next Week

Install Wordpress for your main domain (not a sub-directory) and make an About page that introduces yourself in a few paragraphs. You will use this for your professional website moving forward.
